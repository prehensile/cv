## Team lead, researcher, creative technologist.

### Glue person, consensus-builder, facilitator. Tinkerer, prototyper, committed generalist. Emerging futurist. Data science lab assistant. AI whisperer.

In over two decades working in creative technology, I've developed a good nose for emerging technologies and how they might be put to use by professionals and the public.

I've made websites, games, 3D environments, toys, mobile and desktop apps, interactive stories, electronics, art installations, many prototypes in and between software and hardware, and in one memorable case building a giant talking throne for a Christmas event in a Royal Palace. I've experimented with digital storytelling, natural language processing, spatial audio, machine learning and made art from edge-cases of speech recognition and computer vision.

I have led successful teams both technical and cross-disciplinary â€” the latter is where my heart is. I've done a lot of design, concepting, and pitching and I am trained in video & audio production.

## Professional skills

Skilled facilitator and workshop leader. Empathetic communicator and consensus-builder. [Glue person](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/glue-people-one-most-desired-job-market-enza-artino/). Adept at communicating with creative, management, and engineering staff on their own terms and fostering communication between disciplines. Engaging public speaker and precise and thoughtful writer.

## Technical skills

Expert in Python and skilled in JavaScript, both client and server-side. Proficient in HTML & CSS, with some C++ (mostly openFrameworks), Java, Processing, and C#. 

I can generally pick up whatever stack is most useful for the job at hand. 

Former iOS and Flash developer. Happy hacking with web-facing APIs and fluent in JSON, XML, OAuth, REST etc. I know my way around a *nix command line, and frequently tinker with VPSs in various parts of The Cloud. Familiar with AWS, Azure, Heroku, and fly.io. Regularly work with Raspberry Pi, comfortable with Arduino and intermediate electronics. I'm competent with a soldering iron.

I've recently been experimenting with open-source large lanaguage models (LLMs) as co-pilots for research tasks, and have been getting a feel for generative visual AI via Stable Diffusion and ComfyUI.

I began my freelance career in 2008. I was getting restless at Preloaded; my instincts were leading me to the iPhone as the next platform where interesting creative work was happening. There then followed... 

The freedom afforded as a freelancer meant that I also got involved in a number of art projects...

I started my Lonodn agency career at Tonic (now defunct) in 2004, where I made Flash microsites. I moved on to Preloaded in 2004, where I continued to build Flash experiences and games. I really learned the craft of creative software development during these years; highlights include Launchball which eventually racked over 10 million plays, and won a slew of awards including Best in Show and Best Game at SXSWi 2008 and Technical Excellence at Flash in the Can.
